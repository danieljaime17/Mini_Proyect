Object Detection with MobileNet-SSD

This Python script performs object detection on images using OpenCV and a pre-trained MobileNet-SSD model. It can detect and draw bounding boxes around 20 different object classes (including persons, cars, animals, and common objects) in input images.

Key features:

Uses Caffe-based MobileNet-SSD deep learning model

Processes images and displays detected objects with bounding boxes

Supports common object classes from the PASCAL VOC dataset

Shows both original and processed images with detection results

Requirements: OpenCV, NumPy
